    <h1>Algorithms</h1>
    <p class="fancy"> Simply put an algorithm is a list of directions which explain how to do a task. 
      An algorithm is instructions for a computer on how to complete a task. Algorithms are not just a computer term but are also used in everyday life.
      A cake recipe could be considered an algorithm as it has step by step instructions on how to complete the task of making a cake. 
      On computers, algorism can be used to create things like lists of people that belong on a no-fly list or create recommendations on Netflix.</p>
