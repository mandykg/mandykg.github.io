    <h1>Algorithms</h1>
    <p class="fancy"> Simply put an algorithm is a list of directions which explain how to do a task. 
      An algorithm is instructions for a computer on how to complete a task. Algorithms are not just a computer term but are also used in everyday life.
      A cake recipe could be considered an algorithm as it has step by step instructions on how to complete the task of making a cake. 
      On computers, algorism can be used to create things like lists of people that belong on a no-fly list or create recommendations on Netflix.</p> 
     <h2>Positive Impacts Algorithms Have</h2>
      <table class= "unfancy">
        <tr>
         <td class="fancy">
          <ol class="Fonts">
           <li> Algorithms can have positive impacts on the world. They are highly efficiency because they can reduce work time for people.
             They do this by working much quicker than a person can which can speed up the process of a task. 
             They can help with issues like reducing pollution and fixing transportation issues. 
             The do this by identifying congestion and then providing a different quicker path to a location.  </li>
           <li> Algorithms also have a positive impact on police, government and banks. It can improve police work by identifying high crime areas to send police to work.
             It has a positive impact on the government because an automated process can help with monitoring and regulation. 
             This includes things like traffic offences and it can cut down on bureaucracy. 
             It also helps banks because it allows more people to get loans because the more data the bank has the less risk the have meaning the can hand out more loans.</li>

    <h3>Negative Impacts Algorithms Have</h3>
      <table class= "unfancy">
        <tr>
         <td class="fancy">
          <ol class="Fonts">
           <li> While algorithms are useful, they can also have a negative impact on society. 
             A big concern with algorithms is that as the popularity of them increase the unemployment rates will increase with them. 
             The concern is that algorithmic tasks that people perform can be easily replaced by computer which will result in people, that depended on have these 
             jobs, becoming unemployed. These people will be replaced with a machine that will be more productive and cost efficient and this will result in a huge 
             negative impact on the work force. </li>
           <li> Another concern with algorithms is that they are created by people and the algorithms will show the creators perspectives and values. These algorithms
             will present information that the creator favors and will not be unbiased.  Unless these algorithms can be modified by users, they will continue to 
             contain conscious and unconscious bias. It will continue to be a challenge to support the creators of algorithms and still protect users from seeing 
             political biases and discrimination. This will have a negative impact on society because these algorithms will favor efficiency over correctness and 
             fairness.</li>
