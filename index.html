     <h1>Algorithms</h1>
      <p class="fancy"> Simply put an algorithm is a list of directions which explain how to do a task. 
         An algorithm is instructions for a computer on how to complete a task. Algorithms are not just a computer term but are also used in everyday life.
         A cake recipe could be considered an algorithm as it has step by step instructions on how to complete the task of making a cake. 
         On computers, algorism can be used to create things like lists of people that belong on a no-fly list or create recommendations on Netflix.</p> 
     <h1>Positive Impacts Algorithms Have</h1>
        <table class= "unfancy">
           <tr>
             <td class="fancy">
               <ol class="Fonts">
                 <li> Algorithms can have positive impacts on the world. They are highly efficiency because they can reduce work time for people.They do this by working 
                  much quicker than a person can which can speed up the process of a task. They can help with issues like reducing pollution and fixing transportation 
                  issues. The do this by identifying congestion and then providing a different quicker path to a location.  </li>
                 <li> Algorithms also have a positive impact on police, government and banks. It can improve police work by identifying high crime areas to send police
                  to work. It has a positive impact on the government because an automated process can help with monitoring and regulation. This includes things like 
                   traffic offences and it can cut down on bureaucracy. It also helps banks because it allows more people to get loans because the more data the bank has
                  the less risk the have meaning the can hand out more loans.</li>

     <h1>Algorithms Positive Impact Example #1</h1>
      <p class="fancy"> Google maps is an example of a great algorithm. It looks at the destination you are trying to get to determine the easiest and quickest path
        to get there. It takes in consideration construction and congestion and will reroute your path to better be able to help. This algorithm is great for reducing
        accidents and reducing congestion on the roads. </p>

     <h1>Algorithms Positive Impact Example #2</h1>
      <p class="fancy"> Another great example of algorithms is Netflix suggestions. Netflix looks at data such as what people watch, what they watch yesterday or a
        year ago and what time of day. All of these things help to build an algorithm to determine what type of suggestions Netflix will give you. This algorithm is
        so widely used yet not many people realize that these suggestions make up 80% of the TV shows they watch. </p>

     <h1>Negative Impacts Algorithms Have</h1>
       <table class= "unfancy">
           <tr>
              <td class="fancy">
                <ol class="Fonts">
                   <li> While algorithms are useful, they can also have a negative impact on society. 
                    A big concern with algorithms is that as the popularity of them increase the unemployment rates will increase with them. The concern is that algorithmic
                    tasks that people perform can be easily replaced by computer which will result in people, that depended on have these jobs, becoming unemployed. These 
                    people will be replaced with a machine that will be more productive and cost efficient and this will result in a huge negative impact on the work force. </li>
                   <li> Another concern with algorithms is that they are created by people and the algorithms will show the creators perspectives and values. These algorithms
                    will present information that the creator favors and will not be unbiased.  Unless these algorithms can be modified by users, they will continue to 
                    contain conscious and unconscious bias. It will continue to be a challenge to support the creators of algorithms and still protect users from seeing 
                    political biases and discrimination. This will have a negative impact on society because these algorithms will favor efficiency over correctness and 
                    fairness.</li>

      <h1>Algorithms Negative Impact Example</h1>
      <p class="fancy"> An example of an algorithm would be on a flight in 2017 was over booked go the airline used an algorithm to determine who should get off the
        plane. A man by the name of Dr. David Dao was forcibly remove from the plane and it was later speculated that discrimination played a part in why he was
        chosen to be removed. What happen was an algorithm chose who should get off the plane by looking at the cost of everyone’s ticket, how often they flew and
        when they checked in.  These algorithms are created with the intention of doing good but unfortunately it doesn’t always. This happens because algorithms
        aren’t completely objective as it will show the bias of its creator. </p>
