      <h2>What is An Algorithm?</h2>
      <p class="fancy"> An algorithm is simply a list of directions which explain how to do a task. 
         An algorithm is also a set of instructions for a computer on how to complete a task. An algorithm is not just a computer term but is also used in everyday life.
         For example, a cake recipe could be considered an algorithm as it has step by step instructions on how to complete the task of making a cake. 
         On computers, algorithms can be used to create things like lists of people that belong on a no-fly list or create recommendations on Netflix.</p> 
     <h2>Positive Impacts Algorithms Have</h2>
           <ol class="Fonts">
              <li> Algorithms can have positive impacts on the world. They are highly efficient because they can reduce work time for people.They do this by working 
                  much quicker than a person can which can speed up the process of a task. They can help with issues like reducing pollution and fixing transportation 
                  issues. The do this by identifying congestion and then providing a different quicker path to a location.  <br> <br> </li>
               <li> Algorithms also have a positive impact on police, government and banks. It can improve police work by identifying high crime areas to send police
                  to work. It has a positive impact on the government because an automated process can help with monitoring and regulation. This includes things like 
                   traffic offences and it can cut down on bureaucracy. It also helps banks as it allows more people to get loans because the more data the bank has,
                  the lower the risk. This means the bank can hand out more loans.</li>

                <p class="fancy"> Google maps is an example of a great algorithm. It looks at the destination you are trying to get to and determines the easiest and quickest path
                    to get there. It takes construction and congestion into consideration and will reroute your path to find a quicker path. This algorithm is great for reducing
                    accidents and reducing congestion on the roads. </p>   
              </td> 
              <td>
               <p class="fancy"> Another great example of algorithms is Netflix suggestions. Netflix looks at data such as what people watched today, yesterday or a
                            year ago and how long they watched for. All of these things help to build an algorithm to determine what type of suggestions Netflix will give you. This algorithm is
                            widely used yet not many people realize that these suggestions make up 80% of the TV shows they watch. </p>

     <h2>Negative Impacts Algorithms Have</h2>
                <ol class="Fonts">
                   <li> While algorithms are useful, they can also have a negative impact on society. 
                    A big concern with algorithms is that as the popularity of them increase the unemployment rates will increase with them. The concern is that algorithmic
                    tasks that people perform can be easily replaced by computers which will result in the people that did these jobs becoming unemployed. These 
                    people will be replaced with a machine that will be more productive and cost efficient and this will result in a huge negative impact on the work force. <br> <br> </li>
                   <li> Another concern with algorithms is that they are created by people and the algorithms will show the creators' perspectives and values. These algorithms
                    will present information that the creator favors and will be biased.  Unless these algorithms can be modified by users, they will continue to 
                    contain conscious and unconscious bias. It will continue to be a challenge to support the creators of algorithms and still protect users from seeing 
                    political biases and discrimination. This will have a negative impact on society because these algorithms will favor efficiency over correctness and 
                    fairness.</li>

      <h2>Algorithms Negative Impact Example</h2>
        <p class="fancy"> An example of an algorithm would be a flight in 2017. The flight was over booked so the airline used an algorithm to determine who should get off the
        plane. A man by the name of Dr. David Dao was forcibly removed from the plane and it was later speculated that discrimination played a part in why he was
        chosen to be removed. But, what really happened was an algorithm chose who should get off the plane by looking at the cost of everyone’s ticket, how often they flew and
        when they checked in.  These algorithms are created with the intention of doing good but unfortunately they don't always work that way. This happens because algorithms
        aren’t completely objective as it will show the bias of its creator. </p>
